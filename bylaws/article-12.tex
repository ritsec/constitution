\section{Suspension of the Bylaws}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Any club member can motion to suspend the bylaws within the RITSEC
    Constitution with approval from RITSEC E-Board. A written motion must be
    submitted to RITSEC E-Board for consideration, and must include the
    rationale for why the bylaw should be suspended and a time frame for which
    the suspension shall be in effect. The RITSEC E-Board needs at least
    three-fourths E-Board vote to approve the suspension.
\end{enumerate}
