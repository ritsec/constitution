\Article{Suspension of the Bylaws}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Any club member can motion to suspend the bylaws within the RITSEC Constitution
	      with approval from RITSEC E-Board. A written motion must be submitted to RITSEC
	      E-Board for consideration; the written motion must include the rationale for
	      why the bylaw should be suspended and a time frame for which the suspension
	      shall be in effect. The RITSEC E-Board needs at least three-fourths E-Board
	      vote to approve the suspension.
