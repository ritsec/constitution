      \item The constitutional by-laws contained herein shall come under review with the
            expectation of modernization, at most, every five years since the last major
            edit. This review is the responsibility of the President and the Vice

% SECTION B: E-BOARD CONSTITUTION AMENDMENTS
\Section{E-Board Constitution Amendments}

\begin{enumerate}
      \item E-Board has the right to veto any amendment proposed by a club member to the
            constitution. 10 RITSEC ยง C (IV) defines how club members can circumvent an
            E-Board veto.

            % TODO: update citation
      \item E-Board also has the right to make amendments to the constitution and/or
            bylaws. A vote by all active E-Board members must reach at least three-fourths
            majority to make amendments to the constitution and/or bylaws. Once the vote
            has passed E-Board must present the change(s) to the club. %chktex 36
            \begin{enumerate}
                  \item E-Board must expressly identify the changes made in the amendment as well as
                        show the original. E-Board must provide publicly available copies of the
                        Constitution.
            \end{enumerate}
      \item If club members disapprove of the new amendments to the constitution and/or
            bylaws, they may override it. This override will follow the procedures detailed
            in 10 RITSEC ยง C (IV).

% SECTION C: CLUB MEMBER AMENDMENTS
\Section{Club Member Constitution Amendments}

\begin{enumerate}
      \item In the event a club member wishes to change the constitution and/or bylaws,
            they must first notify E-Board. The club member must then submit, at minimum, a
            summary of the changes they wish to make, to the RITSEC E-Board. These changes
            must be identified as detailed in 10 RITSEC ยง B (II) (A).
            % TODO: update citation
      \item E-Board must make time to discuss the change(s) at the nearest E-Board meeting
            or, at most, two weeks after the documents are received. The E-Board must
            decide to veto or approve the proposed changes.
      \item If approved, the club member must then present their petitioned change to the
            entire club. The club members will then vote on the petitioned change and must
            reach three-fourths majority to pass.
      \item The members may override E-Board's decision or veto by reaching a three-fourths
            majority in a club vote.
