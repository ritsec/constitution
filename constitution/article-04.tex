	      research position, other work position, or study abroad term, that does not
	      make them ineligible for membership as defined under 4 RITSEC ยง A (I) (A); the
	      membership requirement defined under 4 RITSEC ยง A (I) (B) shall be waived for
	      that member during that period of time.
